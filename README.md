# Assignment 3 – Music Genre Discovery (Unsupervised)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where we extract audio features from .wav files and apply unsupervised clustering to discover structure in music data.  
We work with:
- a labeled dataset (with genres) for comparison and interpretation
- an unlabeled dataset on which clustering is performed

The main focus is building an audio feature pipeline (using librosa) and comparing clustering approaches, with final methods including Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and NMF.
